We try to avoid them in R, if we want speed.\n\n## Functions\n\nFunctions work exactly like they do in R, however, there are three fundamental differences:\n\n- there is no need for {} brackets (thank god)\n- indenting (Julia requires seperate parts of a function to be indented - don't worry, VS Code should do this for you)\n- scoping (we'll attempt to explain this later)\n- functions always start with the word `function` and end with the word `end`. \n-to store something that is calculated in a function, you use the `return` command.\n\nLet's begin with a simple function - adding 2 to any number\n\n::: {#a24692d0 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction plus_two(x)\n    return x+2\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\nplus_two (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's use it now by providing an defining and x value, and asking for the function to return the new value.\n\n::: {#ec48c530 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nx_in = 33\nx_out = plus_two(x_in)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\n35\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBecause we've defined `x_out`, we can request it...\n\n::: {#a6a8c649 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nx_out\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n35\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Positional Arguments\n\nAs in **R**, input variables for functions have a specified and fixed order unless they have a default value which is explicitly specified. For instance, we can build a function that measures body weight on different planets, but defaults to estimating weight on earth with a gravitational force of 9.81:\n\n::: {#d4a3345c .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction bodyweight(BW_earth, g = 9.81)\n    # bw should be in kg.\n    return BW_earth*g/9.81\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\nbodyweight (generic function with 2 methods)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the function is called bodyweight, it requires in the first position a weight in kg on earth and then defaults to estimating weight on earth by using g = 9.81\n\n::: {#22338518 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nbodyweight(75)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n75.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, if we want to estimate they same bodyweight on Mars, where gravity is 3.72, you can specify the g-value.\n\n::: {#db5f174f .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nbodyweight(75, 3.72)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```\n28.44036697247706\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n\n::: {#ca231910 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# function with keyword arguments:\n# here, b and d are fixed = 2\n# a is positional\n# c is a keyword argument\n# the addition of ; before c means that c is an keyword argument and can be specified in any order, but must be named\nfunction key_word(a, b=2; c, d=2) \n    return a + b + c + d\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```\nkey_word (generic function with 2 methods)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we specify _position_ 1 (a) and that c = 3\n\n::: {#6409f694 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nkey_word(1, c = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we specify c = 3, and then position 1\n\n::: {#60cb13ff .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nkey_word(c=3, 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```\n8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we specify position 1 (a), redefine position 2 (b = 6) and declare c = 7.\n\n::: {#3b8ed855 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nkey_word(1, 6, c=7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n```\n16\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that this DOES NOT work, because we've failed to define c.

Note how `person in unique(persons)` iterates and how you can embed a variable's value in a text string.\n\n::: {#5849f23f .cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\npersons = [\"Alice\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Bob2\", \"Carl\", \"Dan\"]\n\nfor person in unique(persons)\n    println(\"Hello $person\")\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello Alice\nHello Bob\nHello Bob2\nHello Carl\nHello Dan\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are tons of different functions that can be helpful when building loops. Take a few minutes to look into the help files for `eachindex`, `eachcol`, `eachrow` and `enumerate`. They all provide slightly different ways of telling Julia how you want to loop over a problem. Also, remember that loops aren't just for allocation, they can also be very useful when doing calculations.\n\n### if, else, breaks\nWhen building a loop, it is often meaningful to stop or modify the looping process when a certain condition is met. For example, we can use the `break`, `if` and `else` statements to stop a for loop when i exceeds a given value (e.g. 10):\n\n::: {#2b5360ec .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# if and break:\nfor i in 1:100\n    println(i) # print i\n    if i >10\n        break # stop the loop with i >10\n    end   \nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#26f3e15a .cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# this loop can be modified using an if-else statement:\n# even though we are iterating to 100, it stops at 10.\nfor j in 1:100\n    if j >10\n        break # stop the loop with i >10\n    else\n        crj = j^3\n        println(\"J is = $j\") # print i\n        println(\"The Cube of $j is $crj\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nJ is = 1\nThe Cube of 1 is 1\nJ is = 2\nThe Cube of 2 is 8\nJ is = 3\nThe Cube of 3 is 27\nJ is = 4\nThe Cube of 4 is 64\nJ is = 5\nThe Cube of 5 is 125\nJ is = 6\nThe Cube of 6 is 216\nJ is = 7\nThe Cube of 7 is 343\nJ is = 8\nThe Cube of 8 is 512\nJ is = 9\nThe Cube of 9 is 729\nJ is = 10\nThe Cube of 10 is 1000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou'll notice that every statement requires it's own set of `for` and `end` points, and is indented as per Julia's requirements. `if` and `else` statements can be very useful when building experiments: for example we might want to stop simulating a network's dynamics if more than 50% of the species have gone extinct.\n\n### continue and while\n\n#### continue\nThe `continue` command is the opposite to `break` and can be useful when you want to skip an iteration but not stop the loop:\n\n::: {#dfb29b27 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfor i in 1:30\n    # this reads: is it false that i is a multiple of 3?\n    if i % 3 == false\n        continue # makes the loop skip iterations that are a multiple of 3\n    else println(\"$i is not a multiple of 3\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1 is not a multiple of 3\n2 is not a multiple of 3\n4 is not a multiple of 3\n5 is not a multiple of 3\n7 is not a multiple of 3\n8 is not a multiple of 3\n10 is not a multiple of 3\n11 is not a multiple of 3\n13 is not a multiple of 3\n14 is not a multiple of 3\n16 is not a multiple of 3\n17 is not a multiple of 3\n19 is not a multiple of 3\n20 is not a multiple of 3\n22 is not a multiple of 3\n23 is not a multiple of 3\n25 is not a multiple of 3\n26 is not a multiple of 3\n28 is not a multiple of 3\n29 is not a multiple of 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCan you figure out what the code would be for keeping even numbers only?

But you do specify the starting value. The `while` loop can be very useful because sometimes you simply don't know how many iterations you might need.\n\nIn the above code, you might have spotted the word `global`. Variables can exist in the `local` or `global` scope. If a variable exists inside a loop or function it is `local` and if you want to save it beyond the loop (i.e., in your workspace) you have to make it `global` - more on this below.\n\n## combine a function and a loop\n\nLet's get a bit more complicated.  Above, you created a function that added 2 to any number.  Let's embed that in a loop and introduce `enumerate`.  Quite often, there are functions you may want to apply to multiple things, and this is the example of how to do that!\n\n::: {#b988baf1 .cell execution_count=30}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# make a vector - these are input values to our function\nvv = [1,2,3,7,9,11]\n\n# enumerate takes a special two variable starter: \"(index, value)\"\n# note how we print the index, then the output and then a line break with \\n\nfor (i, v) in enumerate(vv)\n    out = plus_two(v)\n    println(\"this is element $i of vv\")\n    println(\"$v plus 2 is equal to $out\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nthis is element 1 of vv\n1 plus 2 is equal to 3\n\nthis is element 2 of vv\n2 plus 2 is equal to 4\n\nthis is element 3 of vv\n3 plus 2 is equal to 5\n\nthis is element 4 of vv\n7 plus 2 is equal to 9\n\nthis is element 5 of vv\n9 plus 2 is equal to 11\n\nthis is element 6 of vv\n11 plus 2 is equal to 13\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scoping\nScoping refers to the accessibility of a variable within your project.
