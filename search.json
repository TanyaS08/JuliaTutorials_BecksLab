    "text": "Making your first Julia project\nAs with working in R and RStudio, we advocate working in a contained project environment when using Julia. Each unique project may require a different setup (e.g. packages, package versions, working directories, data locations, etc.).\nTo set up a project in VS Code:\n\nCreating a folder at a location of your choosing (e.g. within your Documents folder). This can be on GoogleDrive, Dropbox or OneDrive. This is OK.\nName the folder with relevant works. Here we will use Julia - VS code - how to.\nNavigate to VSCode and open your new project by clicking on the ‘Explorer’ symbol (top left symbol on the activity bar) and click Open Folder and navigate your finder or explorer to the Julia - VS code - how to folder.\n\nthis folder becomes the working directory (same as when using an .RProject in R)\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Your Project\n\n\n\nCreate a new file (a script) in your directory: do this by using cmd-N (mac) or ctrl-N (windows) or File -&gt; New File or by left clicking -&gt; New File within the directory pane\nName your script as your see fit but please remember to include the .jl file extension (e.g. JuliaTuto.jl). the .jl file extension tells VS Code you want to use the Julia programming language. To save your script at any time use cmd-S (MAC) OR ctrl-S (windows) or File &gt; Save.\n\nNote, you can also open a project in VS Code by right-clicking on your folder (in Finder, Windows file explorer or Linux nautilus) and selecting Open with -&gt; Other -&gt; VS Code.\n\n\n\nActivating the REPL and running some code.\nThis sequence of figures aligns with the instructions below.\n\n\n\nInitiating and using the REPL\n\n\nNow that you have an active project and a new script file you can open the Julia REPL. REPL stands for read, execute, print and loop. The REPL is like the console in R and is where the magic happens. In Eva’s words, it’s VS Code’s way of using Julia for a brain.\nTo do this you type F1 or cmd/ctrl - shift-p or View -&gt; Command Palette and choose Julia REPL. The command palette will appear as a drop down menu with a search function at the top of the page.\nNow that you have an interface with Julia as a brain, you can actually do something! Try this: type print(\"Hello world\") in the REPL and press Enter/Return. If you’ve done all of the above correctly, Hello world should print in the REPL.\nNow, you can also make a ‘script’. Type ctrl-n or cmd-n and a document will open at the top. There will be a prompt/link to select your language. Click the link and, yes, search for and choose Julia.\nNext, type print(\"Hello world\") in the script. Just like RStudio, you can send the information in the script to the REPL. There are two ways to do this. First, and probably what you’ll want, is shift-enter(return). This will send the line of code you are on, and move to the next line. ctrl-enter(return) submits the line but does not move the cursor. Try it!",

This section of the tutorials is designed to introduce a newer, faster and more flexible version of the Julia package.\nA very basic interpretation of the model is as follows:\n\nThe model is a model of biomass dynamics, not numbers of individuals.\nThe model is comprised of an equation for plants (producers) an equation for consumers (herbivores, predators).\nPlants have traits that make their biomass grow and sets their carrying capacity; they are eaten by consumers via an equation describing a functional response. To link to ecology courses you have, this can be logistic growth for the plant and a type II functional response.\nConsumer have three sets of traits. One is metabolism, which is a rate that describes losses of biomass due to, well, metabolism! The second set of traits correspond to the functional response - for example describing attack rates and handling times of prey items. The third corresponds to the numerical response, or the conversion of biomass they eat into new biomass (e.g. babies)\nWe can make complex networks and systems of these equations by letting many of these parameters scale with body size via the rules of allometry and the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. This trick expands the two equations to n = number of species when we provide the toolbox with a list of species biomasses.\nEmbedded in this process are rules about how to distribute species of different sizes across trophic levels, so that we end up with predators, omnivores, herbivores and plants.

    "section": "A More Complex Example",
    "text": "A More Complex Example\n\nStep 1: Generate the initial network\nIn order to run the BEFW model with a more complex network, we have to construct an initial food web network (an adjacency matrix) using the niche model. The network is characterised by the number of species in the network and its connectance/complexity value.\nNote that we are now using functionality provided by the EcologicalNetworks package.\n\nS = 20 # define the number of species\nC = 0.2 # define the connectance (complexity) of the network\n\n# construct the food web\nRandom.seed!(12325) # ensures your network and this one are the same\nfoodweb_niche = Foodweb(:niche; S = S, C = C)\n\n\n\nStep 2. Setting up the paramters, body masses (species) and running the model!\nAs above, our next step is to define a vector of bodymasses and then pass this, and the network to the simulate function. Here we combine the Uniform function from the Distributions package with the rand function from the Random package.\n\n# construct the equations and fixed parameters\n# see below for body size dependent parameters etc\nparams_niche = default_model(foodweb_niche)\n\n# define bodymasses between 0 and 1 and get S = 20 of them.\n# this will ensure your plot looks like the one in the document\nRandom.seed!(123)\nB0 = rand(S)\nt = 300\n\n# simulate using params and bodymasses\n# note additional argument tmax for max time steps\n# default is 300\nsim_niche = simulate(params_niche, B0, t)\n\n\n\nStep 3. Visualising the dynamics\nNow we can move to plotting again. Note how we now ask for the time directly from the simulate object and all of the biomasses from that object as well.\nNote too how we can supress the legend (which covers some of the time series).\n\nplot(sim_niche, legend = false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne game to play now is to alter the bodymass distribution. rand selects a randon uniform number between 0 and 1. Can you figure out how to make the distribution uniform between 0 and 10? See what that does.\n\n\nA bit more about the process: dissecting the ModelParameters\nLet’s dissect the default_model object a bit, to understand just a bit more about what is going on.\n\nparams_niche\n\n\nModel (alias for EcologicalNetworksDynamics.Framework.System{&lt;inner parms&gt;}) with 17 components:\n  - Species: 20 (:s1, :s2, :s3, :s4, ..., :s20)\n  - Foodweb: 82 links\n  - Body masses: [396.6757314506745, 1000.0, 138.23722273578997, 150.62580571223663, ..., 1.0]\n  - Metabolic classes: [:invertebrate, :invertebrate, :invertebrate, :invertebrate, ..., :producer]\n  - GrowthRate: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., 1.0]\n  - Carrying capacity: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., 1.0]\n  - ProducersCompetition: 1.0\n  - LogisticGrowth\n  - Efficiency: 0.45 to 0.85.\n  - MaximumConsumption: [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, ..., ·]\n  - Hill exponent: 2.0\n  - Consumers preferences: 0.07692307692307693 to 1.0.\n  - Intra-specific interference: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., ·]\n  - Half-saturation density: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, ..., ·]\n  - BioenergeticResponse\n  - Metabolism: [0.0703591752903408, 0.05583797347522218, 0.09157425582526797, 0.08963029015067063, ..., 0.0]\n  - Mortality: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0]\n\n\n\nWalking through this\n\n🚧 This needs to be updated - might be explicitly highlighted in END documentation\n\n\nThe network component defines the food web and reports the number of species and the links\nthe environment component reports on values of the carrying capacity (K) and the baseline temperature (T). Note that K is specified only for the basal species via [1, 1, ... nothing, nothing]. All the producers have the same K at this point (1,1,1…). The presence of the T suggests that we can ultimately work with climate change by running the model at different temperatures. There is a way to make some of the biorates and components of the functional response (see 3, 4) dependent not only on body mass, but also on temperature.\nthe biorates component contains detail on parameters central to making the model reflect a bit of reality: d is …; r is the intrinsic rate of increase (population growth rate) for the producers (plants); x and y are parameters associated with metabolic rates and consumption rates of the consumers (non-plant species). Finally, e is an efficiency/assimilation rate for the consumers eating either plants or other animals.\nthe functional_response component defines the type of consumption function being used (e.g. Type I, II, or III sensu classic ecology and Holling). The functional response defines the interaction strength between species and how consumers change how much they eat dependent on the amount (density) of resource available.There are two options. The default Bioenergetic Response corresponds to a phenomenological formulation where there are just two variables that describe how consumer consumption varies with resource density: a half-saturation parameter and an asymptote. The alternative called Classic Response is more trait based and includes the parameters attack rate and handling time. There are several other features of the functional response that can be manipulated, and these are introduced in later tutorials.\nthe producer_growth details the default that all plants are growing logistically.\nthe temperature responsecomponewnt defines the absence or presence of temperature dependence, and when present, the shape of the relationship between biorates and functional response parameters and temperature.\n\n\n\nHelper Functions: What can we do with the outputs?\n\n🚧 This should be revised by an END user.\n\nAs noted in the pre-amble, we are most often interested in additional information about the scenarios we build with the models. These include, for example, total biomass, biodiversity and stability. Let’s see how we can calculate some of these.\n\nHow long till steady state?\nWe can find out how long the simulations ran to reach steady state - remember that this is a deterministic model that typically reaches equilibrium for all species that survive.\n\nsize(sim_niche.t)\n\n(51,)\n\n\n\n\nWho went extinct and when?\nWe can also find out who went extinct, and when. You saw some of that detail, I hope, in the output of simulate.\n\nget_extinct_species(sim_niche)\n\n\n\nBiomass, Diversity and Stability\nFirst, we can get a measure of total biomass in the community, at equilibrium, and that of each species. Note how you can get the components too.\n\nsim_niche.u\n\n51-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:\n [0.906299638797481, 0.44349373245960455, 0.7456733811393941, 0.5120830400366143, 0.2538490889415096,

The CV is a measure of standardised variation - the standard deviation / mean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation). It is not ‘stability’ in the strict mathematical sense, but an estimation of how variable the dynamics are.\ndefined as the average coefficient of variation estimated across all of the coefficients of variation for each species.\nThe master function is coefficient_of_variation and delivers four results - Coefficient of Variation (CV) of community biomass and its partition into average species CV (community_cv above), species mean CV and synchrony, along with the variation of each species; following Thibault & Connolly (2013):\n\ncoefficient_of_variation(sim_niche)\n\nNote the warning…. do you understand what it’s talking about? Think about the extinctions detail above. You can follow the instructions, right?\n\ncoefficient_of_variation(sim_niche, last = 4)\n\nYou can get parts of this with specific helper functions, such as:\n\ncommunity_cv(sim_niche, last = 4)\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s next\nThe next section will introduce how to create simulations where we work with multiple networks and collect data across these. We do this using loops, and collect information in a data frame. We then work on how to embed additional changes to parameters in the loops as well.",

    "text": "In R, the plotting of data is either done in base R or via the {ggplot2} package. If you’re a base R person, you’ll probably feel more comfortable with the Plots package. Alternatively, if you prefer {ggplot2}, the StatsPlots and Gadfly package is the closest thing you’ll find in Julia. We’ll introduce both in the following sections.\nIt is worth noting that Julia is based on a ‘Just in Time’ compiler (or JIT) so the first time you call a function it needs to compile, and can take longer than expected. This is especially true when rendering a plot. Consequently, the first plot you make might take some time but it gets significantly faster after that.",

We advise that you always name and assign your plots (e.g. p1, p2, etc). The Plots package also has it’s own tutorial for plotting in Julia.",

    "text": "In the previous chapter, we learned how to make networks and run a simulation. We did this for a simple tri-trophic chain where we specified the network with a matrix of ones and zeros, and for a more complex network defined by the niche model where we specified species richness and connectance. We also learned how to visualise the simulations and to collect several metrics about the simulations, including detail on biomass, diversity and stability.\nIn this tutorial, we are going to learn how to do experiments. We’ll learn first how to generate multiple networks and collect information on how network structure impacts our metrics. Then we’ll learn how to manipulate parameters in the model, again collecting information on how variation in these parameters impacts our metrics.\nFor example, we might be interested in how species richness or connectance impacts biomass and stability. Or how the carrying capacity of the producers impacts biomass and stability of the community (e.g. bottom up processes). We’ll look at both of these.\n\nGetting Setup\nAs with our previous exercises, we need to have a few packages that allow making networks, simulating them and collecting the data\n\nusing DataFrames, Plots, Random, Distributions\nusing EcologicalNetworksDynamics\n\n\n\nYour (re)introduction to loops: making multiple networks example\nOne of the tricks to doing experiments is learning how to run a loop. Julia is super-fast with running loops. This is a bit different to R, which has a bad rep for loops. It’s not terrible. But Julia is built to do loops fast.\nWhat we will do here is build a simple loop that makes 3 networks, each with a different species richness, but the same connectance.\nNote here that we introduce the use of the argument tol_C. Because the niche model produces networks based on probability theory (it uses the beta-distribution), the connectance we ask for is not always the connectance we get. The tol_C argument ensure that connectance is within a tolerance range - in this case, having asked for C = 0.2 and a tol_C = 0.01 we will get 0.19 &lt; C &lt; 2.01. This is like embedding a while loop within the FoodWeb function! We note too that the function nichemodel can take a value of L instead of C, and there is an associated tol_L argument for this choice too.\n\nRandom.seed!(12325) # ensures your network and this one are the same\n\nS = [10,20,30] # define the number of species\nC = 0.2 # define the connectance (complexity) of the network\n\n# collection zone for the networks\nnets = []\n\n# construct the food webs\n# we loop over the 3 values of S\n# we use push!() to add the food webs to nets\n# always start with a for and end with an end.\nfor i in 1:3\n    push!(nets, Foodweb(:niche; S = S[i], C = C))\nend\n\nGreat. Let’s see if we got what we expected in nets.\n\nnets\n\n3-element Vector{Any}:\n blueprint for Foodweb with 22 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 81 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 182 trophic links\n\n\nMagnificent, we have three networs and that’s a win. We also see that they are each for a different and appropriate S. Win no. 2. We can actually now check to see what the connectances actually are. Again, we’ll use a loop, println and introduce you to the details of the FoodWeb object.\nFirst, let’s look at one of the networks.\n\nnets[1]\n\nblueprint for Foodweb with 22 trophic links:\n  A: 10×10 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 22 stored entries:\n ⋅  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\n ⋅  1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n\n\nWe can see that the A element is the matrix and you can guess that the M is the body Masses. We also find tha there are 3 producers and 7 invertebrates and it is derived from the niche model\n\na side note on the metabolic classes. The default parameterisation, and nearly all of the published work with the BEFW, uses invertebrates for all the non-producer species. It is possible to include others. But the data, currently, are not helpful (low volume) in supporting robust inference with these types of species.\n\nNow, recall that we can look specifically at the matrix by using nets[1].A which grabs the A part. We introduce here the function sum. As in R, sum() does what it says on the tin: for a vector, it addes up all the numbers and for a matrix, it does the same! In our case here, when sum() is applied to a matrix of ones and zeros, it counts all the 1’s…. thus is the estimate of the number of links in the community.\nFinally, we note (again?) that size applied to the network returns two numbers - the number of rows and the number of columns. For our networks, the matrix is square. So grabbing one of these (rows = [1]) and squaring it delivers our ‘potential number of links’ (e.g. \\(species^2\\)).\nWe can put that all together here to define connectance as \\(Con = links/S^2\\). Do be careful to watch where you put the various []’s. One of them is about the index (i.e. [i]) and the other is about the dimension ([1]) of the matrix.\n\nfor i in 1:3\n    println(sum(nets[i].A)/size(nets[i].A)[1]^2)\n    end\n\n0.22\n0.2025\n0.20222222222222222\n\n\n\nDifferent ways to run loops.\nThere is another way to make this set of networks. Here we use a while loop to create 3 networks with the same species richness and connectance. We might need to do this to generate replicates. This is a good exercise with the niche model as it reminds you that it is a probabilistic tool… you can get several networks with the same S and C, but the links will be in slightly different places.\nwhile loops work on conditions… for example, if we want three networks, we could ask that the loop keep working to make the networks until we have three. To do this, we need a monitoring variable that lets us assess where we are against our target.\nLets see how to do that.\n\n# how many replicates do we want?\nreps = 3\n\nbegin\n    # list to store networks\n    global networks = []\n    # monitoring variable l (the letter l)\n    global l = length(networks)\n\n    # while loop\n    while l &lt; reps # reps is 3 here...\n        # generate a network\n        A = Foodweb(:niche; S = 20, C = 0.15)\n        # add the network to the set\n        push!(networks, A)\n        # update the monitor\n        global l = length(networks)\n    end\nend\n\nThe term global means that the obects are made available in our global environment and should be there for us to see. If you look closely at the mini-matrices, you’ll see they are all different in micro-structure, despite having the same number of links and the same connectance.\n\nNOTE: the presentation of the matrix is very specific here… the rows correspond to the predators and the columns the resources. Obstensibly, the ranking is by body size, so small things are at the upper left. This view shows that big things tend to eat small and big things, while small things eat small. Historically, the reflection (pivot around the diagnol) has also been used, where the predators are the columns and the resources the rows. This lead to a ‘feature’ of real and theoretical networks aligning, call upper triangularity. In this latter presentation, most of the links would be in the upper triangle. In the current presentation, the links are in the lower triangle. So we can just call the feature triangularity. The niche model reproduces this triangularity.\n\n\nnetworks\n\n3-element Vector{Any}:\n blueprint for Foodweb with 55 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 63 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 62 trophic links\n\n\n\nnetworks[1].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 55 stored entries:\n⎡⠉⠉⠉⣉⡡⠐⠒⠒⠒⠂⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠔⠒⠒⠒⠂⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠨⠕⠒⠒⠒⠂⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠒⠿⡅⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⎦\n\n\n\nnetworks[2].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 63 stored entries:\n⎡⠉⠩⠭⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠒⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠈⠒⣒⠒⠒⠶⠤⠀⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠒⠀⠨⣭⣭⡤⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠤⠤⠉⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠛⎦\n\n\n\nnetworks[3].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 62 stored entries:\n⎡⣀⣭⣭⣍⣉⣉⡉⠉⠁⠀⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠁⢠⠤⠤⠤⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⢰⣶⠀⠀⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⡀⠀⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⎦\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking the networks to the Ecological Networks Dynamics\nFantastic. Now you are ready for the next steps. We want to run the EcologicalNetworksDynamics model on each of these networks. Furthermore, we want to collect the biomass and stability information for all three into a data frame. Let’s see how we do that.\n\nStep 1: Create the collecting data frame\nFirst, we create the holding pen for our information. We’ll construct a data frame to collect five pieces of information: the network id (1,2 or 3), species richness at the start (our initial S), species richness at the end, total biomass at the end and stability at the end.\n\noutputs = DataFrame(Network = [], Init_Rich = [], Fin_Rich = [], Tot_biomass = [], Shannon_dic = [])\n\n0×5 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nNetwork\nInit_Rich\nFin_Rich\nTot_biomass\nShannon_dic\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: use the pre-defined networks\nWe can use our nets object from above now. Each of these networks has a different species richness.\n\nfor i in 1:3\n\n    # prep: define size of network\n    S = size(nets[i].A)[1]\n\n    # deliver some progress reporting\n    println(\"\\nThis is network: \", i, \"with species richness = \", S,\"\\n\")\n\n    # step A: define model paramters\n    params = default_model(nets[i])\n\n    # step B: define body mass\n    B0 =  rand(S)\n\n    # step C: set number of timestamps\n    t = 300\n\n    # step D: simulate\n    out = simulate(params, B0, t)\n\n    # steps D: calculate metrics\n    fin_rich = richness(out)\n    fin_biomass = total_biomass(out)\n    s_div = shannon_diversity(out)\n\n    # step E: add things to the data frame\n    # note the first arg is the data frame and then\n    # the values we want allocated to the five slots\n    # are in []\n    push!(outputs, [i, S, fin_rich, fin_biomass, s_div])\nend\n\n\nThis is network: 1with species richness = 10\n\n\nThis is network: 2with species richness = 20\n\n\nThis is network: 3with species richness = 30\n\n\n\nAmazing. Let’s see if what we wanted collected has ended up in our data frame. Wonderful! Splendiferous.

We can create a mini- data frame out of this with the following code. key and values are actually extractor functions and collect is translating the extracted information into a vector.\n\n# create a data frame of extinctions\nee1 = DataFrame(who = collect(keys(extinctions)), when = collect(values(extinctions)))\n\nNow we can try and add this information to the plot. For the time being, we’ll focus on adding the times that each of these species goes extinct to our figure. To do this we need to access the extinction time column (when), add a bit of noise/jitter so that times that are really close together can be seen on our x-axis, and then plot these as points with coordinates x = when and y = 0.\n\n# add some jitter for close together events\nexts = ee1[:,2] .+rand.()\n\n# plot\nplot(sim_niche)\n# add jittered extinction events.\nplot!(exts, zeros(size(ee1[:,1])), seriestype = :scatter, legend = false)\n\nPretty cool!\n\n\n\nWhat’s next\nIn the next chapter, you’ll be creating larger experiments with loops over actual parameters in the model, including the predator-prey size ratio, values of carry capacity and the predator-prey size ratio.",

For instance, we can build a function that measures body weight on different planets, but defaults to estimating weight on earth with a gravitational force of 9.81:\n\nfunction bodyweight(BW_earth, g = 9.81)\n    # bw should be in kg.\n    return BW_earth*g/9.81\nend\n\nbodyweight (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nNote that the function is called bodyweight, it requires in the first position a weight in kg on earth and then defaults to estimating weight on earth by using g = 9.81\n\nbodyweight(75)\n\n75.0\n\n\nNow, if we want to estimate they same bodyweight on Mars, where gravity is 3.72, you can specify the g-value.\n\nbodyweight(75, 3.72)\n\n28.44036697247706\n\n\n\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\n# function with keyword arguments:\n# here, b and d are fixed = 2\n# a is positional\n# c is a keyword argument\n# the addition of ; before c means that c is an keyword argument and can be specified in any order, but must be named\nfunction key_word(a, b=2; c, d=2) \n    return a + b + c + d\nend\n\nkey_word (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nHere we specify position 1 (a) and that c = 3\n\nkey_word(1, c = 3)\n\n8\n\n\nHere we specify c = 3, and then position 1\n\nkey_word(c=3, 1)\n\n8\n\n\nHere we specify position 1 (a), redefine position 2 (b = 6) and declare c = 7.\n\nkey_word(1, 6, c=7)\n\n16\n\n\nNote that this DOES NOT work, because we’ve failed to define c. (and or b)\n\nkey_word(1, 8, d=4)\n\nLoadError: UndefKeywordError: keyword argument `c` not assigned\n\n\nTo redefine d, you’d need to define c and d.\n\nkey_word(1, c = 8, d = 4)\n\n15",

    "text": "Loops\n\nFor loops\nFor loops work by iterating over a specified range (e.g. 1-10) at specified intervals (e.g. 1,2,3…). For instance, we might use a for loop to fill an array:\n\nFilling an array\nTo fill an array, we first define an object as an array using [].\n\nI_array = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nLike with function, all loops start with for and end with end. Here we iteratively fill I_array with 1000 random selections of 1 or 2.\n\n# for loop to fill an array:\nfor i in 1:1000\n    # pick from the number 1 or 2 at random \n    # for each i'th step\n    for_test = rand((1,2)) \n    # push! and store for_test in I_array2\n    # Julia is smart enough to do this iteratively\n    # you don't necessarily have to index by `[i]` like you might do in R\n    push!(I_array, for_test) \nend\n\nLet’s look at I_array now\n\nI_array\n\n1000-element Vector{Any}:\n 2\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 2\n 1\n ⋮\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 1\n\n\nLet’s try something more complex, iterating over multiple indices\nA new storage container:\n\ntab = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nNow, we fill the storage container with values of i, j and k. Can you tell which in which order this will happen? The first entry will be [1,1,1]. The second will be [2,1,1]. Do you understand why? Mess around to check.\n\n# nested for loop to fill an array:\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            append!(tab,[[i,j,k]]) # here we've use append! to allocate iteratively to the array as opposed to using push! - both work. \n        end\n    end\nend\n\nLet’s look…\n\ntab\n\n24-element Vector{Any}:\n [1, 1, 1]\n [2, 1, 1]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 2, 1]\n [1, 3, 1]\n [2, 3, 1]\n [1, 1, 2]\n [2, 1, 2]\n [1, 2, 2]\n [2, 2, 2]\n [1, 3, 2]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 1, 3]\n [2, 1, 3]\n [1, 2, 3]\n [2, 2, 3]\n [1, 3, 3]\n [2, 3, 3]\n [1, 1, 4]\n [2, 1, 4]\n [1, 2, 4]\n [2, 2, 4]\n [1, 3, 4]\n [2, 3, 4]\n\n\nWe can also allocate to a multiple dimensional matrix. When working with matrices, we can build them out of zeros and the replace the values.\nHere we start with a three dimensional array with 4 two x three matrices.\n\nthreeDmatrix = zeros(2,3,4)\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\nNow, let’s do a nested loop again, but this time into the matrices. The element we are adding each iteration is the sum of i+j+k.\nCan you guess how this works?\n\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            # note default is by column....\n            # first element allocated is 1+1+1, then 2+1+1 and this is first col\n            # then 1+2+1 and 2+2+1 into the second col\n            # then 1+3+1 and 2+3+1 into the third col\n            threeDmatrix[i,j,k] = i+j+k\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n\nthreeDmatrix\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 3.0  4.0  5.0\n 4.0  5.0  6.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 4.0  5.0  6.0\n 5.0  6.0  7.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 5.0  6.0  7.0\n 6.0  7.0  8.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 6.0  7.0  8.0\n 7.0  8.0  9.0\n\n\nFinally, note that we can use println to provide a basic marker what what is happening: we show two ways to do this in the code.\n\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            #println(i,\"-\",j,\"-\",k) # multiple quotes\n            println(\"$i-$j-$k\") # one quote, $ to grab variables\n            \n            # note default is by column....\n            # first element allocated is 1+1+1, then 2+1+1 and this is first col\n            # then 1+2+1 and 2+2+1 into the second col\n            # then 1+3+1 and 2+3+1 into the third col\n            threeDmatrix[i,j,k] = i+j+k\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nAnd just for fun… this println trick can be handy for verbose tracking. Note how person in unique(persons) iterates and how you can embed a variable’s value in a text string.\n\npersons = [\"Alice\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Bob2\", \"Carl\", \"Dan\"]\n\nfor person in unique(persons)\n    println(\"Hello $person\")\nend\n\nHello Alice\nHello Bob\nHello Bob2\nHello Carl\nHello Dan\n\n\nThere are tons of different functions that can be helpful when building loops. Take a few minutes to look into the help files for eachindex, eachcol, eachrow and enumerate. They all provide slightly different ways of telling Julia how you want to loop over a problem. Also, remember that loops aren’t just for allocation, they can also be very useful when doing calculations.\n\n\n\nif, else, breaks\nWhen building a loop, it is often meaningful to stop or modify the looping process when a certain condition is met. For example, we can use the break, if and else statements to stop a for loop when i exceeds a given value (e.g. 10):\n\n# if and break:\nfor i in 1:100\n    println(i) # print i\n    if i &gt;10\n        break # stop the loop with i &gt;10\n    end   \nend\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n# this loop can be modified using an if-else statement:\n# even though we are iterating to 100, it stops at 10.\nfor j in 1:100\n    if j &gt;10\n        break # stop the loop with i &gt;10\n    else\n        crj = j^3\n        println(\"J is = $j\") # print i\n        println(\"The Cube of $j is $crj\")\n    end\nend\n\nJ is = 1\nThe Cube of 1 is 1\nJ is = 2\nThe Cube of 2 is 8\nJ is = 3\nThe Cube of 3 is 27\nJ is = 4\nThe Cube of 4 is 64\nJ is = 5\nThe Cube of 5 is 125\nJ is = 6\nThe Cube of 6 is 216\nJ is = 7\nThe Cube of 7 is 343\nJ is = 8\nThe Cube of 8 is 512\nJ is = 9\nThe Cube of 9 is 729\nJ is = 10\nThe Cube of 10 is 1000\n\n\nYou’ll notice that every statement requires it’s own set of for and end points, and is indented as per Julia’s requirements. if and else statements can be very useful when building experiments: for example we might want to stop simulating a network’s dynamics if more than 50% of the species have gone extinct.\n\n\ncontinue and while\n\ncontinue\nThe continue command is the opposite to break and can be useful when you want to skip an iteration but not stop the loop:\n\nfor i in 1:30\n    # this reads: is it false that i is a multiple of 3?\n    if i % 3 == false\n        continue # makes the loop skip iterations that are a multiple of 3\n    else println(\"$i is not a multiple of 3\")\n    end\nend\n\n1 is not a multiple of 3\n2 is not a multiple of 3\n4 is not a multiple of 3\n5 is not a multiple of 3\n7 is not a multiple of 3\n8 is not a multiple of 3\n10 is not a multiple of 3\n11 is not a multiple of 3\n13 is not a multiple of 3\n14 is not a multiple of 3\n16 is not a multiple of 3\n17 is not a multiple of 3\n19 is not a multiple of 3\n20 is not a multiple of 3\n22 is not a multiple of 3\n23 is not a multiple of 3\n25 is not a multiple of 3\n26 is not a multiple of 3\n28 is not a multiple of 3\n29 is not a multiple of 3\n\n\nCan you figure out what the code would be for keeping even numbers only? Note the change of logic from false above to true here.\n\nfor i in 1:10\n    # where is it true that i is a multiple of 2?\n    if i % 2 == true\n        continue # makes the loop skip iterations that are odd\n    else println(\"$i is even\")\n    end\nend\n\n2 is even\n4 is even\n6 is even\n8 is even\n10 is even\n\n\n\n\nwhile\nwhile loops provide an alternative to for loops and allow you to iterate until a certain condition is met:\n\n# counter that is globally scoped (see next section)\n# testval -- try changing this to see how this global variable can be used in \n# the local process below\nglobal j=0\nglobal testval = 17\n\n# note that we started with j = 0!!!\n# justify a condition\nwhile(j&lt;testval) \n    println(\"$j is definitely less than $testval\") # prints j until j &lt; 17\n    # step forward\n    j += 1 # count\nend\n\n0 is definitely less than 17\n1 is definitely less than 17\n2 is definitely less than 17\n3 is definitely less than 17\n4 is definitely less than 17\n5 is definitely less than 17\n6 is definitely less than 17\n7 is definitely less than 17\n8 is definitely less than 17\n9 is definitely less than 17\n10 is definitely less than 17\n11 is definitely less than 17\n12 is definitely less than 17\n13 is definitely less than 17\n14 is definitely less than 17\n15 is definitely less than 17\n16 is definitely less than 17\n\n\nwhile loops don’t require you to specify a looping sequence (e.g. i in 1:100). But you do specify the starting value. The while loop can be very useful because sometimes you simply don’t know how many iterations you might need.\nIn the above code, you might have spotted the word global. Variables can exist in the local or global scope. If a variable exists inside a loop or function it is local and if you want to save it beyond the loop (i.e., in your workspace) you have to make it global - more on this below.",

Notice that Julia converts pi into the unicode symbol!\n\n# allocate a pre-defined number of importance to a variable\n# note that pi is converted to π\n# note2 - you can use \\pi in a julia script to get the unicode π ...\n# this works for numerous greek letters etc.  Like \\lambda for λ\npi_sum = pi\npi_sum\n\nπ = 3.1415926535897...\n\n\nWe can use these unicode symbols (and emojis!), like λ, as objects\n\nλ = 4\nλ\n\n4\n\n\nYou can also assign multiple values to separate variables in a concise manner. Julia can manage something like this:\n\nαi, βi, γi = 1.3, 2.1, exp(39)\n\n# confirm...\nαi, βi, γi\n\n(1.3, 2.1, 8.659340042399374e16)\n\n\n\nAllocating strings\nOf course you can also allocate strings of text to objects. You must use the \"\" and not '' to define strings.\n\nsob = \"School of Biosciences\"\n\n\"School of Biosciences\"\n\n\nYou can combine strings and numbers to print like this. Note how you use $object.name within the text string you are writing… and this works for objects that are text or numeric.\n\nprintln(\"The favourite number in $sob is $n\")\n\nThe favourite number in School of Biosciences is 5\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the Type of object you’ve made\nJulia is very specific about types of objects. Most programming languages are. One way to learn about them is to look at what is made when you make things in different ways.\n\ntypeof(n), typeof(sob), typeof(pi)\n\n(Int64, String, Irrational{:π})\n\n\nJulia is like R and Python in that it can infer the type of object (Integer, Float, etc) on the left hand side of the equals sign - you don’t have to justify it like you do in C. However, you can declare the type if needed e.g.\n\npi_custom = Float64(3.141592)\n\n3.141592\n\n\nFor those of you that are interested, a floating-point object (a Float) is a number that has a decimal place. An Int object is an integer, a number without a decimal place, whereas an Irrational object is a specific type of Float used only for representing some irrational numbers of special significance (e.g. π and γ). The 64 purely refers to 64-bit which is the type of processor your computer uses, most modern computers are 64-bit.\nOccasionally it will be valuable to convert an object from one type to another. For example, n is currently an Integer (Int64), and we might want it to be Float (Float64). To be clear, this is a distinction between 5 and 5.0!\n\ntypeof(n)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nn2 = convert(Float64, n)\ntypeof(n2)\n\nFloat64",

Arrays, for the R users, are best thought of as lists - they are storage boxes for any type of variables and can contain collections of various types. The general way to create an array, in this case and empty one, is the [ ].\n\nempty_array = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nWe will first create an array with the same values as x and then see how collect() is the function that converts this to a vector, and actually lets us see the numbers too!\nFirst, range can be used to make an array. This is very similar to seq() in R and has the two variations - by and length that the R function has. The difference is that by is replaced by the argument step. Note how a very concise summary of this array is presented using information in square brackets [ ]:\n\nx_array1 = range(start = 1, step = 1, stop = 10)\nx_array2 = range(start = 1, stop = 10, length = 5)\n\nx_array1, x_array2\n\n(1:1:10, 1.0:2.25:10.0)\n\n\nYou can also now see that creating arrays is possible with [ ] and the use of the : :\n\nx_array3 = [1:1:10]\n\n1-element Vector{StepRange{Int64, Int64}}:\n 1:1:10\n\n\nQuite often, you want to either see the values, or specifically be using a vector.

Making a matrix in Julia uses the [ ] again, an separates rows of numbers with the ;\n\nmat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]\n\n2×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3\n 4  5  6\n\n\nNote how there are NO commas between the numbers in each row! This is read as ‘rows are separated by ; and columns by spaces’!\nYou can also ‘pre-fill’ a matrix with zeros. This is good practice in loops and programming as pre-filling and replacing variables in a matrix is more efficient than creating the matrix on the fly. Here we demonstrate how to pre-fil a vector, matrix and high dimension array! Matrices can have more than two dimensions!\n\nvec0 = zeros(2) # 2 zeros allocated in a vector\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.0\n 0.0\n\n\n\nmat0 = zeros(2,3) # zeros allocated to 2 rows and 3 columns!\n\n2×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\n\narr0 = zeros(2,3,4) # 2 rows, 3 columns and 4 dimensions!\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\nAccessing values in a matrix follows the same convention as with the vector. The convention is [row, column]\n\nmat[1,2] # value in the first row and second column\n\n2\n\n\n\nmat[1:2, 3] # rows 1 AND 2 in the 3rd column\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 3\n 6\n\n\nFinally, to get a row or column, you need to know that we need a placeholder for the missing bit of what you are asking for.

So the mat object we created earlier will be a matrix of integers i.e. Matrix{Int64}.\n\ntypeof(mat)\n\n\nMatrix{Int64} (alias for Array{Int64, 2})\n\n\n\nSo what happens if we want to replace one of the elements with a Float?\n\nmat[1,2] = 1.5\n\nThis is because we are trying to add a Float to an object that is of the type Integer. What happens if we convert mat to be a matrix of floats and then try again?\n\nmat = convert(Matrix{Float64}, mat)\nmat[1,2] = 1.5\n\n1.5",

    "text": "Some quick tips that we’ve learnt the hard way…\n\nIn the REPL, you can use the up arrow to scroll through past code\nYou can even filter through your past code by typing the first letter of a line previously executed in the REPL. For example, try typing p in the REPL and using the up arrow to scroll through your code history, you should quickly find the last plot command you executed.\nToggle word wrap via View&gt;Toggle Word Wrap or alt-Z\nRed wavy line under code in your script = error in code\nBlue wavy line under code in your script = possible error in code\nErrors and possible errors can be viewed in the PROBLEMS section of the REPL\nYou can view your current variables (similar to the top right hand panel in RStudio) by clicking on the Julia explorer: Julia workspace symbol in the activity bar (three circles). You can then look at them in more detail by clicking the sideways arrow (when allowed).\n\n\nCOPYING versus DEEP COPYING :-)\n\nJulia has a strange copying behaviour where if a = b, any change in b will automatically cause the same change in a. For example, let’s make an array of three numbers:\n\n\naa = [1,2,3]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nHere we make a copy of aa and call it bb.\n\nbb = aa\nprint(bb)\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nNow, we replace the second element of bb with the value 41.\n\nbb[2] = 41\nbb\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\nThe default behaviour of = in Julia is to UPDATE any copy of the array, so we see the same change in aa:\n\naa\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\nWhoa… that’s not what we expect, though it’s pretty cool. This approach is advantageous because it lets Julia save memory, however, it is not ideal.\nTo remedy this, and create copies that don’t update their parent or other offspring, we can force c to be an independent copy of a using the deepcopy function:\n\ncc = deepcopy(aa)\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\n\ncc[3] = 101\naa,cc\n\n([1, 41, 3], [1, 41, 101])\n\n\n\nYou can view a .csv or .txt file by clicking on a file name in the project directory (left panel) - this opens a viewing window. CSV’s also have a built in ‘Preview’ mode - try using right click&gt;Open Preview on a .csv file and check it out.\nDocstrings are a supplement to #-based comments for documenting your workflow. Basically, any string that appears just before an object will be interpreted as documenting it. When you use a docstring it is possible to call that description using help (? in the REPL) or hovering over the object in VSCode. This can be very useful when you start declaring variables or building your own functions.\n\n\n\"a wonderfully documented and described variable\"\nvar = 101\n\nvar\n\n\nyou can (should) also do this with functions\n\n\"\"\"\n    _rategradient(∂X, ∂Y)\n\nReturns the rate of change in units of the values stored in the grid, and the\nangle of the change in wind direction, *i.e.* an angle of 180 means that the\nvalue is increasing *from* the south.

For an R specific analogy these files can be thought as the equivalents of the renv.lock file generated from the {renv} package.\nThe other thing to be aware of in Julia is multiple dispatch, more specifically that it has a very strict type system that will affect the behaviour of a function.

The details of the packages (dependencies) that you install are recorded in the Project.toml (a records of packages that have been installed and their versions - very useful when sharing code as any user can see exactly what version of a package has been used) and the Manifest.toml (all the package dependencies installed - i.e. packages that for a part of the other packages that you have installed) files, these files are machine generated and will update as you add or removed packages while you work so you don’t need to worry too much about interacting with them but its good to know what they mean/do. For an R specific analogy these files can be thought as the equivalents of the renv.lock file generated from the {renv} package.\nThe other thing to be aware of in Julia is multiple dispatch, more specifically that it has a very strict type system that will affect the behaviour of a function. This blog post provides a nice overview of multiple dispatch using Pokemon types but the take-home message here is that it is important that you specify the correct type of an object (something that we will cover in Tutorial 2) and that often times when you run into an error it is because of that… This may seem annoying at first but it does mean that in the long run your code is much ‘safer’ because you won’t (unknowingly) be converting and combining objects that are of different types unless you specifically specify it.\n\n\n\nTable 1: A moving from R to Julia cheatsheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naction\nR\nJulia\n\n\n\n\nchecking current working directory\ngetwd()\npwd()\n\n\ninstall a package\ninstall.package(PACKAGE_NAME)\nPkg.add(PACKAGE_NAME)\n] add PACKAGE_NAME\n\n\ncall/import a package\nlibrary(PACKAGE_NAME)\nusing PACKAGE_NAME\n\n\nresolving naming conflicts (functions from different packages with the same name)\nPACKAGE_NAME::function()\nPACKAGE_NAME.function()\n\n\ncalling column from dataframe\ndf$COL_NAME | df.COL_NAME |\n\n\ncalling the first elements of a dataframe\nhead()\nfirst()\n\n\ncalling the last elements of a dataframe\ntail()\nlast()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simple idea here is to make a Julia script and add the code in these tutorials to your scripts. Make sure you annotate using the # symbol, as we do in R Scripts. We suggest that You have a script associated with each section of the table of contents on the left.",
