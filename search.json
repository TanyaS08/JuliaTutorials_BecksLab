A second benefit of the data frame object is that we can export it as a csv file and import this into R where we may prefer working on plotting and statistics.\nTo this end, here we will also introduce the CSV package, which is very handy for exporting DataFrame objects to csv files, and importing them as well, if you’d like.",

    "text": "The Data Frame\nTo initialise a dataframe you use the DataFrame function from the DataFrames package:\n\ndat = DataFrame(col1=[], col2=[], col3=[]) # we use [] to specify an empty column of any type and size.\n\n0×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\ncol1\ncol2\ncol3\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternately, you can specify the data type for each column.\n\ndat1 = DataFrame(col1=Float64[], col2=Int64[], col3=Float64[])\n\n0×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\ncol1\ncol2\ncol3\n\n\n\nFloat64\nInt64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, col1 is not the only label you provide: variable names are super important and the conventions we use in R are also important here in Julia, e.g. a_b or AaBa but not a b (no spaces allowed) or a.b (because the (dot) . functions as an operator).\n\n# provide informative column titles using:\ndat2 = DataFrame(species=[], size=[], rate=[])\n\n0×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nspecies\nsize\nrate\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllocating or adding data to a data frame.\nTo add data to a dataframe, we use the push!

It is worth noting that push! can only append one row at a time. But since Julia is so good with loops (compared to R), this will make adding data to a dataframe really easy, and we’ll learn how to do this in the next tutorial. What makes the ! (bang) function very useful is that you can append (or remove, with pop!()) items to an object without having to assign it.\n\nspecies2 = \"D.pulex\"\nsize2 = 1.8\nrate2 = 3.1\n\n# push!() arguments: data frame, data\npush!(dat2, [species2, size2, rate2])\n\n2×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nspecies\nsize\nrate\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n1\nD.magna\n2.2\n4.2\n\n\n2\nD.pulex\n1.8\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper Functions for Data Frames\nYou can print data frames using println\n\nprintln(dat2)\n\n2×3 DataFrame\n Row │ species  size  rate \n     │ Any      Any   Any  \n─────┼─────────────────────\n   1 │ D.magna  2.2   4.2\n   2 │ D.pulex  1.8   3.1\n\n\nThere are first and last function that are like head and tail in R and elsewhere, with a first argument the data frame and the second argument the number of rows.\n\nfirst(dat2, 2)\n\n2×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nspecies\nsize\nrate\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n1\nD.magna\n2.2\n4.2\n\n\n2\nD.pulex\n1.8\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlast(dat2,2)\n\n2×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nspecies\nsize\nrate\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n1\nD.magna\n2.2\n4.2\n\n\n2\nD.pulex\n1.8\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as we learned with matrices and arrays, the [row, column] method also works for data frames:\n\ndat2[1,2]\n\n2.2\n\n\n\ndat2[1,:]\n\nDataFrameRow (3 columns)\n\n\n\nRow\nspecies\nsize\nrate\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n1\nD.magna\n2.2\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat2[:,3]\n\n2-element Vector{Any}:\n 4.2\n 3.1",

    "text": "A More Complex Example\n\nStep 1: Generate the initial network\nIn order to run the BEFW model with a more complex network, we have to construct an initial food web network (an adjacency matrix) using the niche model. The network is characterised by the number of species in the network and its connectance/complexity value.\nNote that we are now using functionality provided by the EcologicalNetworks package.\n\nS = 20 # define the number of species\nC = 0.2 # define the connectance (complexity) of the network\n\n# construct the food web\nRandom.seed!(12325) # ensures your network and this one are the same\nfoodweb_niche = Foodweb(:niche; S = S, C = C)\n\n\n\nStep 2. Setting up the paramters, body masses (species) and running the model!\nAs above, our next step is to define a vector of bodymasses and then pass this, and the network to the simulate function. Here we combine the Uniform function from the Distributions package with the rand function from the Random package.\n\n# construct the equations and fixed parameters\n# see below for body size dependent parameters etc\nparams_niche = default_model(foodweb_niche)\n\n# define bodymasses between 0 and 1 and get S = 20 of them.\n# this will ensure your plot looks like the one in the document\nRandom.seed!(123)\nB0 = rand(S)\nt = 300\n\n# simulate using params and bodymasses\n# note additional argument tmax for max time steps\n# default is 300\nsim_niche = simulate(params_niche, B0, t)\n\n\n\nStep 3. Visualising the dynamics\nNow we can move to plotting again. Note how we now ask for the time directly from the simulate object and all of the biomasses from that object as well.\nNote too how we can supress the legend (which covers some of the time series).\n\nplot(sim_niche, legend = false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne game to play now is to alter the bodymass distribution. rand selects a randon uniform number between 0 and 1. Can you figure out how to make the distribution uniform between 0 and 10? See what that does.\n\n\nA bit more about the process: dissecting the ModelParameters\nLet’s dissect the default_model object a bit, to understand just a bit more about what is going on.\n\nparams_niche\n\n\nModel (alias for EcologicalNetworksDynamics.Framework.System{&lt;inner parms&gt;}) with 17 components:\n  - Species: 20 (:s1, :s2, :s3, :s4, ..., :s20)\n  - Foodweb: 82 links\n  - Body masses: [396.6757314506745, 1000.0, 138.23722273578997, 150.62580571223663, ..., 1.0]\n  - Metabolic classes: [:invertebrate, :invertebrate, :invertebrate, :invertebrate, ..., :producer]\n  - GrowthRate: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., 1.0]\n  - Carrying capacity: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., 1.0]\n  - ProducersCompetition: 1.0\n  - LogisticGrowth\n  - Efficiency: 0.45 to 0.85.\n  - MaximumConsumption: [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, ..., ·]\n  - Hill exponent: 2.0\n  - Consumers preferences: 0.07692307692307693 to 1.0.\n  - Intra-specific interference: [·, ·, ·, ·, ..., ·]\n  - Half-saturation density: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, ..., ·]\n  - BioenergeticResponse\n  - Metabolism: [0.0703591752903408, 0.05583797347522218, 0.09157425582526797, 0.08963029015067063, ..., 0.0]\n  - Mortality: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0]\n\n\n\nWalking through this\n\n🚧 This needs to be updated - might be explicitly highlighted in END documentation\n\n\nThe network component defines the food web and reports the number of species and the links\nthe environment component reports on values of the carrying capacity (K) and the baseline temperature (T). Note that K is specified only for the basal species via [1, 1, ... nothing, nothing]. All the producers have the same K at this point (1,1,1…). The presence of the T suggests that we can ultimately work with climate change by running the model at different temperatures. There is a way to make some of the biorates and components of the functional response (see 3, 4) dependent not only on body mass, but also on temperature.\nthe biorates component contains detail on parameters central to making the model reflect a bit of reality: d is …; r is the intrinsic rate of increase (population growth rate) for the producers (plants); x and y are parameters associated with metabolic rates and consumption rates of the consumers (non-plant species). Finally, e is an efficiency/assimilation rate for the consumers eating either plants or other animals.\nthe functional_response component defines the type of consumption function being used (e.g. Type I, II, or III sensu classic ecology and Holling). The functional response defines the interaction strength between species and how consumers change how much they eat dependent on the amount (density) of resource available.There are two options. The default Bioenergetic Response corresponds to a phenomenological formulation where there are just two variables that describe how consumer consumption varies with resource density: a half-saturation parameter and an asymptote. The alternative called Classic Response is more trait based and includes the parameters attack rate and handling time. There are several other features of the functional response that can be manipulated, and these are introduced in later tutorials.\nthe producer_growth details the default that all plants are growing logistically.\nthe temperature responsecomponewnt defines the absence or presence of temperature dependence, and when present, the shape of the relationship between biorates and functional response parameters and temperature.\n\n\n\nHelper Functions: What can we do with the outputs?\n\n🚧 This should be revised by an END user.\n\nAs noted in the pre-amble, we are most often interested in additional information about the scenarios we build with the models. These include, for example, total biomass, biodiversity and stability. Let’s see how we can calculate some of these.\n\nHow long till steady state?\nWe can find out how long the simulations ran to reach steady state - remember that this is a deterministic model that typically reaches equilibrium for all species that survive.\n\nsize(sim_niche.t)\n\n(51,)\n\n\n\n\nWho went extinct and when?\nWe can also find out who went extinct, and when. You saw some of that detail, I hope, in the output of simulate.\n\nget_extinct_species(sim_niche)\n\n\n\nBiomass, Diversity and Stability\nFirst, we can get a measure of total biomass in the community, at equilibrium, and that of each species. Note how you can get the components too.\n\nsim_niche.u\n\n51-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:\n [0.906299638797481, 0.44349373245960455, 0.7456733811393941, 0.5120830400366143, 0.2538490889415096,

The CV is a measure of standardised variation - the standard deviation / mean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation). It is not ‘stability’ in the strict mathematical sense, but an estimation of how variable the dynamics are.\ndefined as the average coefficient of variation estimated across all of the coefficients of variation for each species.\nThe master function is coefficient_of_variation and delivers four results - Coefficient of Variation (CV) of community biomass and its partition into average species CV (community_cv above), species mean CV and synchrony, along with the variation of each species; following Thibault & Connolly (2013):\n\ncoefficient_of_variation(sim_niche)\n\nNote the warning…. do you understand what it’s talking about? Think about the extinctions detail above. You can follow the instructions, right?\n\ncoefficient_of_variation(sim_niche, last = 4)\n\nYou can get parts of this with specific helper functions, such as:\n\ncommunity_cv(sim_niche, last = 4)\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s next\nThe next section will introduce how to create simulations where we work with multiple networks and collect data across these. We do this using loops, and collect information in a data frame. We then work on how to embed additional changes to parameters in the loops as well.",

    "text": "This document illustrates how to construct and solve differential equations in Julia using the DifferentialEquations.jl package.\nIn particular, we are interested in modelling a two species Lotka-Volterra like (predator-prey/consumer-resource) system. Such systems are fundamental in ecology and form the building blocks of complex networks and the models that represent them.\nFor this tutorial you’ll need the following two packages:\n\nDifferentialEquations.jl to solve the differential equations (same ‘engine’ as the one used by the BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl model)\nPlots.jl to visualise the results\n\nWhile we already have Plots.jl in this project, we just need to ] add DifferentialEquations.\nThe DifferentialEquations.jl can be a tad clunky so the below code might take a while to compile. If you hit errors, we recommend removing (] rm DifferentialEquations) and reinstalling (] add DifferentialEquations) the package.\nYou probably want to start a new script for this exercise. File -&gt; New File -&gt; julia\n\nAn introduction to Differential Equations.\nDifferential equations are frequently used to model the change in variables of interest through time. These changes are often referred to as derivatives (or du/dt). In this case, we are interested in modelling changes in the abundance of a consumer and its resource as a function of the system’s key processes (growth, ingestion of food/foraging and mortality) and its parameters.\nThis type of model can be formalised as a simple Lotka-Volterra predator prey model, consisting of a set of differential equations:\n\nResource dynamics: \\(\\frac{dR}{dt} = r R (1-\\frac{R}{K}) - \\alpha R C\\)\nConsumer dynamics: \\(\\frac{dC}{dt} = e \\alpha R C - m C\\)\n\nwhere \\(R\\) and \\(C\\) are the abundances of the resource and consumer respectively, \\(r\\) is the resource’s growth rate, \\(K\\) is the producer’s carrying capacity, \\(\\alpha\\) is the consumer’s ingestion rate, \\(e\\) is the assimilation efficiency and \\(m\\) is the consumer’s mortality rate.\nTo recall from your ecology modules, this is a system of equations with logistic growth for the producers (plants) and a Type I functional response describing how consumer foraging (the loss of prey caused by predators eating them) varies with prey density, a simple conversion efficiency that translates the functional response (eating the prey) into babies of the consumer (predator reproduction) and then a mortality rate for the consumer/predator.\nA few details to note.\n\nthere is only one source of density dependence in this model/system - logistic growth of the producer. Density dependence is required to generate coexistence and stability.\nthe Type I functional response means that the consumer foraging rate increases with prey density and does not saturate. It means that the mortality rate that consumers impose on the prey is constant and independent of the prey density. It is thus density independent and does not contribute to stability. There are two other functional responses. The Type II, which has saturating consumption rate and generates inverse density dependence, and the Type III, which has accelerating consumption rate with prey density, and thus generates increasing mortality in the prey with increasing prey density, and thus density dependence. It is only Type III functional responses that are linked to consumers/predators stabilising their prey populations. It is also a pretty rare functional response!\nthe consumer mortality rate is also constant and thus density independent.\n\n\n\nHow does this relate to the Bioenergetic Food Web Model?\nThe complex model of consumer - resource interactions that is represented by the BEFW model has at it’s heart two equations: one for producers and one for consumers. So at it’s heart, it is not too different in structure to the model above! However, the differences, spelled out in this paper and this paper, are\n\nthe parameters are functions of body size\nbecause of this, we can expand the number of resource and consumer equations for multiple values of body size\nthis creates a potentially big system of equations, instead of just 2.\n\nHowever, and this is important, the process of solving these equations, whether it is two of them, or 100 of them, is essentially what we are introducing below. If you were to look inside of the BEFW model, you would see the same functions and structure as we introduce here.\n\nThe Three Steps For Simulating Food Web Dynamics\nThere are 3 major steps involved in constructing and solving this model in Julia (these happen to be the same three steps in all programming languages, including R where the deSolve package accomplishes much of this same functionality):\n\nDefine a function for your model (i.e. transform the above differential equations into a function that can be read by the solver). This function tells the solver how the variables of interest (here \\(R\\) and \\(C\\)) change over time.\nDefine the problem. Here, the problem is defined by the function, the parameters (\\(r\\), \\(\\alpha\\), \\(e\\) and \\(m\\)), the initial conditions and the timespan of the simulation. In this step you provide the solver with all the details it needs to find the solution.\nSolve!\n\n\n\nStep 1. Define the function\nHere we construct a function for our model. The function needs to accept the following:\n\ndu (derivatives) - a vector of changes in abundance for each species\nu (values) - a vector of abundance for each species\np (parameters) - a list of parameter values\nt (time) - timespan\n\n\nfunction LV_model(du,u,p,t)\n   # growth rate of the resource (modelled as a logistic growth function)\n   GrowthR = p.growthrate * u[1] * (1 - u[1]/p.K) \n   # rate of resource ingestion by consumer (modelled as a type I functional response)\n   IngestC = p.ingestrate * u[1] * u[2]\n   # mortality of consumer (modelled as density independent)\n   MortC = p.mortrate * u[2]\n   # calculate and store changes in abundance (du/dt):\n   # change in resource abundance\n   du[1] = GrowthR - IngestC\n   # change in consumer abundance\n   du[2] = p.assimeff * IngestC - MortC\nend\n\nLV_model (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nYou’ll notice that in the above function (LV_model), we’ve specified specific parameters using the p.name notation. This is because we’ve opted to store our parameters in a named tuple called p. p is created below but it’s worth noting that when this notation is used e.g., p.growthrate, we are telling Julia that we want to use the value of growthrate that is stored as a named part of our tuple (a fancy name for an object in Julia) p.\n\n\nStep 2. Define the problem\nTo define the problem we first have to fix the system’s parameters, the initial values and the timespan of the simulation:\n\np = (\n    growthrate = 1.0, # growth rate of resource (per day)\n    ingestrate = 0.2, # rate of ingestion (per day)\n    mortrate = 0.2,   # mortality rate of consumer (per day)\n    assimeff = 0.5,   # assimilation efficiency\n    K = 10            # carrying capacity of the system (mmol/m3)\n    )\n\n(growthrate = 1.0, ingestrate = 0.2, mortrate = 0.2, assimeff = 0.5, K = 10)\n\n\nHere, we have chosen to define p as a named tuple (similar to a list in R). A vector or dictionary would also work, however, named tuples are advantageous because they allow us to use explicit names and are unmutable meaning that once it’s created you can’t change it.\n\nInitial values: For simplicity, we start with \\(R = C = 1\\):\n\n\nu0 = [1.0; 1.0]\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.0\n\n\n\nTimespan:\n\n\ntspan = (0.0,100.0) # you have to use a Pair (tuple with 2 values) of floating point numbers.\n\n(0.0, 100.0)\n\n\nWe then formally define the problem by passing the function (LV_model), the parameters (listed in our named tuple p), the initial values (u0) and the timespan (tspan) to ODEProblem():\n\nprob = ODEProblem(LV_model, u0, tspan, p)\n\n\nODEProblem with uType Vector{Float64} and tType Float64. In-place: true\ntimespan: (0.0, 100.0)\nu0: 2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Solve\nTo solve the problem, we pass the ODEProblem object to the solver.\nHere we have chosen to use the default algorithm because it’s a simple problem, however there are several available - see here for more information. These two final steps (define and solve the problem) are analogous to using the deSolve package in R.”\n\nsol = solve(prob)\n\nThe solver produces 2 objects: sol.t and sol.u that respectively store the time steps and the variables of interest through time. Let’s have a look.\n\n\nStep 4. Visualise the outputs”\nOnce the problem has been solved, the results can be explored and plotted. In fact, the DifferentialEquations.jl package has its own built in plotting recipe that provides a very fast and convenient way of visualising the abundance of the two species through time:\n\nplot(sol, \n    ylabel = \"Abundance\", \n    xlabel = \"Time\", \n    title = \"Lotka-Volterra\", \n    label = [\"prey\" \"predator\"], \n    linestyle = [:dash :dot], \n    lw = 2) \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to note here, when plotting in Julia you don’t need to separate label names (label = [prey predator]) or linestyles (linestyle = [:dash :dot]) with a comma as you would in R. This will also be case for most plotting options in Julia.\n\n\nStep 5. Play some games\nNow that you see how this works, perhaps you can do a bit of an experiment by varying things in the p = (parameters) part of the code?\n\nCan you increase the number of time steps?\nWhat happens when you increase K?\nWhat happens when you increase or decrease growthrate?\nWhat happens when you change the ingestrate\n\n\n\nEXTRA CREDIT\nIf you are really keen…. how about trying to run the model in a loop over 3 values of growthrate, collect the final population size of the consumer and resource in a data frame with three columns (growthrate, finalCons, finalRes), and plot these values?",

    "text": "Making your first Julia project\nAs with working in R and RStudio, we advocate working in a contained project environment when using Julia. Each unique project may require a different setup (e.g. packages, package versions, working directories, data locations, etc.).\nTo set up a project in VS Code:\n\nCreating a folder at a location of your choosing (e.g. within your Documents folder). This can be on GoogleDrive, Dropbox or OneDrive. This is OK.\nName the folder with relevant works. Here we will use Julia - VS code - how to.\nNavigate to VSCode and open your new project by clicking on the ‘Explorer’ symbol (top left symbol on the activity bar) and click Open Folder and navigate your finder or explorer to the Julia - VS code - how to folder.\n\nthis folder becomes the working directory (same as when using an .RProject in R)\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Your Project\n\n\n\nCreate a new file (a script) in your directory: do this by using cmd-N (mac) or ctrl-N (windows) or File -&gt; New File or by left clicking -&gt; New File within the directory pane\nName your script as your see fit but please remember to include the .jl file extension (e.g. JuliaTuto.jl). the .jl file extension tells VS Code you want to use the Julia programming language. To save your script at any time use cmd-S (MAC) OR ctrl-S (windows) or File &gt; Save.\n\nNote, you can also open a project in VS Code by right-clicking on your folder (in Finder, Windows file explorer or Linux nautilus) and selecting Open with -&gt; Other -&gt; VS Code.\n\n\n\nActivating the REPL and running some code.\nThis sequence of figures aligns with the instructions below.\n\n\n\nInitiating and using the REPL\n\n\nNow that you have an active project and a new script file you can open the Julia REPL. REPL stands for read, execute, print and loop. The REPL is like the console in R and is where the magic happens. In Eva’s words, it’s VS Code’s way of using Julia for a brain.\nTo do this you type F1 or cmd/ctrl - shift-p or View -&gt; Command Palette and choose Julia REPL. The command palette will appear as a drop down menu with a search function at the top of the page.\nNow that you have an interface with Julia as a brain, you can actually do something! Try this: type print(\"Hello world\") in the REPL and press Enter/Return. If you’ve done all of the above correctly, Hello world should print in the REPL.\nNow, you can also make a ‘script’. Type ctrl-n or cmd-n and a document will open at the top. There will be a prompt/link to select your language. Click the link and, yes, search for and choose Julia.\nNext, type print(\"Hello world\") in the script. Just like RStudio, you can send the information in the script to the REPL. There are two ways to do this. First, and probably what you’ll want, is shift-enter(return). This will send the line of code you are on, and move to the next line. ctrl-enter(return) submits the line but does not move the cursor. Try it!",

The Julia package manager (Pkg) allows you to do that easily: Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages, Pkg is designed around environments: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name (text taken directly from the documentation).\n\nGetting started: activating your project.\nActivating your project is something that only needs doing once per computer.

    "text": "Some quick tips that we’ve learnt the hard way…\n\nIn the REPL, you can use the up arrow to scroll through past code\nYou can even filter through your past code by typing the first letter of a line previously executed in the REPL. For example, try typing p in the REPL and using the up arrow to scroll through your code history, you should quickly find the last plot command you executed.\nToggle word wrap via View&gt;Toggle Word Wrap or alt-Z\nRed wavy line under code in your script = error in code\nBlue wavy line under code in your script = possible error in code\nErrors and possible errors can be viewed in the PROBLEMS section of the REPL\nYou can view your current variables (similar to the top right hand panel in RStudio) by clicking on the Julia explorer: Julia workspace symbol in the activity bar (three circles). You can then look at them in more detail by clicking the sideways arrow (when allowed).\n\n\nCOPYING versus DEEP COPYING :-)\n\nJulia has a strange copying aspect where if a=b, any change in b will automatically cause the same change in a. For example, let’s make an array of three numbers:\n\n\naa = [1,2,3]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nHere we make a copy of aa and call it bb.\n\nbb = aa\nprint(bb)\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nNow, we replace the second element of bb with the value 41.\n\nbb[2] = 41\nbb\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\nThe default behaviour of = in Julia is to UPDATE any copy of the array, also:\n\naa\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\nWhoa… that’s not what we expect, though it’s pretty cool. This approach is advantageous because it lets Julia save memory, however, it is not ideal.\nTo remedy this, and create copies that don’t update their parent or other offspring, we can force c to be an independent copy of a using the deepcopy function:\n\ncc = deepcopy(aa)\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 41\n  3\n\n\n\ncc[3] = 101\naa,cc\n\n([1, 41, 3], [1, 41, 101])\n\n\n\nYou can view a .csv or .txt file by clicking on a file name in the project directory (left panel) - this opens a viewing window. CSV’s also have a built in ‘Preview’ mode - try using right click&gt;Open Preview on a .csv file and check it out.\nDocstrings are a supplement to #-based comments for documenting your workflow. Basically, any string that appears just before an object will be interpreted as documenting it. When you use a docstring it is possible to call that description using help (? in the REPL) or hovering over the object in VSCode.

We’ll introduce both in the following sections.\nIt is worth noting that Julia is based on a ‘Just in Time’ compiler (or JIT) so the first time you call a function it needs to compile, and can take longer than expected.

We advise that you always name and assign your plots (e.g. p1, p2, etc). The Plots package also has it’s own tutorial for plotting in Julia.",

    "text": "In the previous chapter, we learned how to make networks and run a simulation. We did this for a simple tri-trophic chain where we specified the network with a matrix of ones and zeros, and for a more complex network defined by the niche model where we specified species richness and connectance. We also learned how to visualise the simulations and to collect several metrics about the simulations, including detail on biomass, diversity and stability.\nIn this tutorial, we are going to learn how to do experiments. We’ll learn first how to generate multiple networks and collect information on how network structure impacts our metrics. Then we’ll learn how to manipulate parameters in the model, again collecting information on how variation in these parameters impacts our metrics.\nFor example, we might be interested in how species richness or connectance impacts biomass and stability. Or how the carrying capacity of the producers impacts biomass and stability of the community (e.g. bottom up processes). We’ll look at both of these.\n\nGetting Setup\nAs with our previous exercises, we need to have a few packages that allow making networks, simulating them and collecting the data\n\nusing DataFrames, Plots, Random, Distributions\nusing EcologicalNetworksDynamics\n\n\n\nYour (re)introduction to loops: making multiple networks example\nOne of the tricks to doing experiments is learning how to run a loop. Julia is super-fast with running loops. This is a bit different to R, which has a bad rep for loops. It’s not terrible. But Julia is built to do loops fast.\nWhat we will do here is build a simple loop that makes 3 networks, each with a different species richness, but the same connectance.\nNote here that we introduce the use of the argument tol_C. Because the niche model produces networks based on probability theory (it uses the beta-distribution), the connectance we ask for is not always the connectance we get. The tol_C argument ensure that connectance is within a tolerance range - in this case, having asked for C = 0.2 and a tol_C = 0.01 we will get 0.19 &lt; C &lt; 2.01. This is like embedding a while loop within the FoodWeb function! We note too that the function nichemodel can take a value of L instead of C, and there is an associated tol_L argument for this choice too.\n\nRandom.seed!(12325) # ensures your network and this one are the same\n\nS = [10,20,30] # define the number of species\nC = 0.2 # define the connectance (complexity) of the network\n\n# collection zone for the networks\nnets = []\n\n# construct the food webs\n# we loop over the 3 values of S\n# we use push!() to add the food webs to nets\n# always start with a for and end with an end.\nfor i in 1:3\n    push!(nets, Foodweb(:niche; S = S[i], C = C))\nend\n\nGreat. Let’s see if we got what we expected in nets.\n\nnets\n\n3-element Vector{Any}:\n blueprint for Foodweb with 22 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 81 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 182 trophic links\n\n\nMagnificent, we have three networs and that’s a win. We also see that they are each for a different and appropriate S. Win no. 2. We can actually now check to see what the connectances actually are. Again, we’ll use a loop, println and introduce you to the details of the FoodWeb object.\nFirst, let’s look at one of the networks.\n\nnets[1]\n\nblueprint for Foodweb with 22 trophic links:\n  A: 10×10 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 22 stored entries:\n ⋅  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\n ⋅  1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1\n ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅\n\n\nWe can see that the A element is the matrix and you can guess that the M is the body Masses. We also find tha there are 3 producers and 7 invertebrates and it is derived from the niche model\n\na side note on the metabolic classes. The default parameterisation, and nearly all of the published work with the BEFW, uses invertebrates for all the non-producer species. It is possible to include others. But the data, currently, are not helpful (low volume) in supporting robust inference with these types of species.\n\nNow, recall that we can look specifically at the matrix by using nets[1].A which grabs the A part. We introduce here the function sum. As in R, sum() does what it says on the tin: for a vector, it addes up all the numbers and for a matrix, it does the same! In our case here, when sum() is applied to a matrix of ones and zeros, it counts all the 1’s…. thus is the estimate of the number of links in the community.\nFinally, we note (again?) that size applied to the network returns two numbers - the number of rows and the number of columns. For our networks, the matrix is square. So grabbing one of these (rows = [1]) and squaring it delivers our ‘potential number of links’ (e.g. \\(species^2\\)).\nWe can put that all together here to define connectance as \\(Con = links/S^2\\). Do be careful to watch where you put the various []’s. One of them is about the index (i.e. [i]) and the other is about the dimension ([1]) of the matrix.\n\nfor i in 1:3\n    println(sum(nets[i].A)/size(nets[i].A)[1]^2)\n    end\n\n0.22\n0.2025\n0.20222222222222222\n\n\n\nDifferent ways to run loops.\nThere is another way to make this set of networks. Here we use a while loop to create 3 networks with the same species richness and connectance. We might need to do this to generate replicates. This is a good exercise with the niche model as it reminds you that it is a probabilistic tool… you can get several networks with the same S and C, but the links will be in slightly different places.\nwhile loops work on conditions… for example, if we want three networks, we could ask that the loop keep working to make the networks until we have three. To do this, we need a monitoring variable that lets us assess where we are against our target.\nLets see how to do that.\n\n# how many replicates do we want?\nreps = 3\n\nbegin\n    # list to store networks\n    global networks = []\n    # monitoring variable l (the letter l)\n    global l = length(networks)\n\n    # while loop\n    while l &lt; reps # reps is 3 here...\n        # generate a network\n        A = Foodweb(:niche; S = 20, C = 0.15)\n        # add the network to the set\n        push!(networks, A)\n        # update the monitor\n        global l = length(networks)\n    end\nend\n\nThe term global means that the obects are made available in our global environment and should be there for us to see. If you look closely at the mini-matrices, you’ll see they are all different in micro-structure, despite having the same number of links and the same connectance.\n\nNOTE: the presentation of the matrix is very specific here… the rows correspond to the predators and the columns the resources. Obstensibly, the ranking is by body size, so small things are at the upper left. This view shows that big things tend to eat small and big things, while small things eat small. Historically, the reflection (pivot around the diagnol) has also been used, where the predators are the columns and the resources the rows. This lead to a ‘feature’ of real and theoretical networks aligning, call upper triangularity. In this latter presentation, most of the links would be in the upper triangle. In the current presentation, the links are in the lower triangle. So we can just call the feature triangularity. The niche model reproduces this triangularity.\n\n\nnetworks\n\n3-element Vector{Any}:\n blueprint for Foodweb with 55 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 63 trophic links\n blueprint for Foodweb with 62 trophic links\n\n\n\nnetworks[1].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 55 stored entries:\n⎡⠉⠉⠉⣉⡡⠐⠒⠒⠒⠂⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠔⠒⠒⠒⠂⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠨⠕⠒⠒⠒⠂⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠒⠿⡅⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⎦\n\n\n\nnetworks[2].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 63 stored entries:\n⎡⠉⠩⠭⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠒⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠈⠒⣒⠒⠒⠶⠤⠀⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠒⠀⠨⣭⣭⡤⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠤⠤⠉⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠛⎦\n\n\n\nnetworks[3].A\n\n20×20 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 62 stored entries:\n⎡⣀⣭⣭⣍⣉⣉⡉⠉⠁⠀⎤\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠁⢠⠤⠤⠤⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⢰⣶⠀⠀⎥\n⎢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⡀⠀⎥\n⎣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⎦\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking the networks to the Ecological Networks Dynamics\nFantastic. Now you are ready for the next steps. We want to run the EcologicalNetworksDynamics model on each of these networks. Furthermore, we want to collect the biomass and stability information for all three into a data frame. Let’s see how we do that.\n\nStep 1: Create the collecting data frame\nFirst, we create the holding pen for our information. We’ll construct a data frame to collect five pieces of information: the network id (1,2 or 3), species richness at the start (our initial S), species richness at the end, total biomass at the end and stability at the end.\n\noutputs = DataFrame(Network = [], Init_Rich = [], Fin_Rich = [], Tot_biomass = [], Shannon_dic = [])\n\n0×5 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nNetwork\nInit_Rich\nFin_Rich\nTot_biomass\nShannon_dic\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: use the pre-defined networks\nWe can use our nets object from above now. Each of these networks has a different species richness.\n\nfor i in 1:3\n\n    # prep: define size of network\n    S = size(nets[i].A)[1]\n\n    # deliver some progress reporting\n    println(\"\\nThis is network: \", i, \"with species richness = \", S,\"\\n\")\n\n    # step A: define model paramters\n    params = default_model(nets[i])\n\n    # step B: define body mass\n    B0 =  rand(S)\n\n    # step C: set number of timestamps\n    t = 300\n\n    # step D: simulate\n    out = simulate(params, B0, t)\n\n    # steps D: calculate metrics\n    fin_rich = richness(out)\n    fin_biomass = total_biomass(out)\n    s_div = shannon_diversity(out)\n\n    # step E: add things to the data frame\n    # note the first arg is the data frame and then\n    # the values we want allocated to the five slots\n    # are in []\n    push!(outputs, [i, S, fin_rich, fin_biomass, s_div])\nend\n\n\nThis is network: 1with species richness = 10\n\n\nThis is network: 2with species richness = 20\n\n\nThis is network: 3with species richness = 30\n\n\n\nAmazing.

information on which species go extinct and when they do.\n\n# collect and organise extinctions\nextinctions = get_extinct_species(sim_niche)\n\nThis is a Dict object. The numbers on the left of the =&gt; are known as the keys and the numbers on the right are values. We can create a mini- data frame out of this with the following code. key and values are actually extractor functions and collect is translating the extracted information into a vector.\n\n# create a data frame of extinctions\nee1 = DataFrame(who = collect(keys(extinctions)), when = collect(values(extinctions)))\n\nNow we can try and add this information to the plot. For the time being, we’ll focus on adding the times that each of these species goes extinct to our figure. To do this we need to access the extinction time column (when), add a bit of noise/jitter so that times that are really close together can be seen on our x-axis, and then plot these as points with coordinates x = when and y = 0.\n\n# add some jitter for close together events\nexts = ee1[:,2] .+rand.()\n\n# plot\nplot(sim_niche)\n# add jittered extinction events.\nplot!(exts, zeros(size(ee1[:,1])), seriestype = :scatter, legend = false)\n\nPretty cool!\n\n\n\nWhat’s next\nIn the next chapter, you’ll be creating larger experiments with loops over actual parameters in the model, including the predator-prey size ratio, values of carry capacity and the predator-prey size ratio.",

For instance, we can build a function that measures body weight on different planets, but defaults to estimating weight on earth with a gravitational force of 9.81:\n\nfunction bodyweight(BW_earth, g = 9.81)\n    # bw should be in kg.\n    return BW_earth*g/9.81\nend\n\nbodyweight (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nNote that the function is called bodyweight, it requires in the first position a weight in kg on earth and then defaults to estimating weight on earth by using g = 9.81\n\nbodyweight(75)\n\n75.0\n\n\nNow, if we want to estimate they same bodyweight on Mars, where gravity is 3.72, you can specify the g-value.\n\nbodyweight(75, 3.72)\n\n28.44036697247706\n\n\n\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\n# function with keyword arguments:\n# here, b and d are fixed = 2\n# a is positional\n# c is a keyword argument\n# the addition of ; before c means that c is an keyword argument and can be specified in any order, but must be named\nfunction key_word(a, b=2; c, d=2) \n    return a + b + c + d\nend\n\nkey_word (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nHere we specify position 1 (a) and that c = 3\n\nkey_word(1, c = 3)\n\n8\n\n\nHere we specify c = 3, and then position 1\n\nkey_word(c=3, 1)\n\n8\n\n\nHere we specify position 1 (a), redefine position 2 (b = 6) and declare c = 7.\n\nkey_word(1, 6, c=7)\n\n16\n\n\nNote that this DOES NOT work, because we’ve failed to define c. (and or b)\n\nkey_word(1, 8, d=4)\n\nLoadError: UndefKeywordError: keyword argument `c` not assigned\n\n\nTo redefine d, you’d need to define c and d.\n\nkey_word(1, c = 8, d = 4)\n\n15",

    "section": "Loops",
    "text": "Loops\n\nFor loops\nFor loops work by iterating over a specified range (e.g. 1-10) at specified intervals (e.g. 1,2,3…). For instance, we might use a for loop to fill an array:\n\nFilling an array\nTo fill an array, we first define an object as an array using [].\n\nI_array = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nLike with function, all loops start with for and end with end. Here we iteratively fill I_array with 1000 random selections of 1 or 2.\n\n# for loop to fill an array:\nfor i in 1:1000\n    # pick from the number 1 or 2 at random \n    # for each i'th step\n    for_test = rand((1,2)) \n    # push! and store for_test in I_array2\n    # Julia is smart enough to do this iteratively\n    # you don't necessarily have to index by `[i]` like you might do in R\n    push!(I_array, for_test) \nend\n\nLet’s look at I_array now\n\nI_array\n\n1000-element Vector{Any}:\n 1\n 2\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 2\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 1\n ⋮\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 2\n 1\n\n\nLet’s try something more complex, iterating over multiple indices\nA new storage container:\n\ntab = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nNow, we fill the storage container with values of i, j and k. Can you tell which in which order this will happen? The first entry will be [1,1,1]. The second will be [2,1,1]. Do you understand why? Mess around to check.\n\n# nested for loop to fill an array:\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            append!(tab,[[i,j,k]]) # here we've use append! to allocate iteratively to the array as opposed to using push! - both work. \n        end\n    end\nend\n\nLet’s look…\n\ntab\n\n24-element Vector{Any}:\n [1, 1, 1]\n [2, 1, 1]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 2, 1]\n [1, 3, 1]\n [2, 3, 1]\n [1, 1, 2]\n [2, 1, 2]\n [1, 2, 2]\n [2, 2, 2]\n [1, 3, 2]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 1, 3]\n [2, 1, 3]\n [1, 2, 3]\n [2, 2, 3]\n [1, 3, 3]\n [2, 3, 3]\n [1, 1, 4]\n [2, 1, 4]\n [1, 2, 4]\n [2, 2, 4]\n [1, 3, 4]\n [2, 3, 4]\n\n\nWe can also allocate to a multiple dimensional matrix. When working with matrices, we can build them out of zeros and the replace the values.\nHere we start with a three dimensional array with 4 two x three matrices.\n\nthreeDmatrix = zeros(2,3,4)\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\nNow, let’s do a nested loop again, but this time into the matrices. The element we are adding each iteration is the sum of i+j+k.\nCan you guess how this works?\n\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            # note default is by column....\n            # first element allocated is 1+1+1, then 2+1+1 and this is first col\n            # then 1+2+1 and 2+2+1 into the second col\n            # then 1+3+1 and 2+3+1 into the third col\n            threeDmatrix[i,j,k] = i+j+k\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n\nthreeDmatrix\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 3.0  4.0  5.0\n 4.0  5.0  6.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 4.0  5.0  6.0\n 5.0  6.0  7.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 5.0  6.0  7.0\n 6.0  7.0  8.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 6.0  7.0  8.0\n 7.0  8.0  9.0\n\n\nFinally, note that we can use println to provide a basic marker what what is happening: we show two ways to do this in the code.\n\nfor k in 1:4\n    for j in 1:3\n        for i in 1:2\n            #println(i,\"-\",j,\"-\",k) # multiple quotes\n            println(\"$i-$j-$k\") # one quote, $ to grab variables\n            \n            # note default is by column....\n            # first element allocated is 1+1+1, then 2+1+1 and this is first col\n            # then 1+2+1 and 2+2+1 into the second col\n            # then 1+3+1 and 2+3+1 into the third col\n            threeDmatrix[i,j,k] = i+j+k\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nAnd just for fun… this println trick can be handy for verbose tracking. Note how person in unique(persons) iterates and how you can embed a variable’s value in a text string.\n\npersons = [\"Alice\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Bob2\", \"Carl\", \"Dan\"]\n\nfor person in unique(persons)\n    println(\"Hello $person\")\nend\n\nHello Alice\nHello Bob\nHello Bob2\nHello Carl\nHello Dan\n\n\nThere are tons of different functions that can be helpful when building loops. Take a few minutes to look into the help files for eachindex, eachcol, eachrow and enumerate. They all provide slightly different ways of telling Julia how you want to loop over a problem. Also, remember that loops aren’t just for allocation, they can also be very useful when doing calculations.\n\n\n\nif, else, breaks\nWhen building a loop, it is often meaningful to stop or modify the looping process when a certain condition is met. For example, we can use the break, if and else statements to stop a for loop when i exceeds a given value (e.g. 10):\n\n# if and break:\nfor i in 1:100\n    println(i) # print i\n    if i &gt;10\n        break # stop the loop with i &gt;10\n    end   \nend\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n# this loop can be modified using an if-else statement:\n# even though we are iterating to 100, it stops at 10.\nfor j in 1:100\n    if j &gt;10\n        break # stop the loop with i &gt;10\n    else\n        crj = j^3\n        println(\"J is = $j\") # print i\n        println(\"The Cube of $j is $crj\")\n    end\nend\n\nJ is = 1\nThe Cube of 1 is 1\nJ is = 2\nThe Cube of 2 is 8\nJ is = 3\nThe Cube of 3 is 27\nJ is = 4\nThe Cube of 4 is 64\nJ is = 5\nThe Cube of 5 is 125\nJ is = 6\nThe Cube of 6 is 216\nJ is = 7\nThe Cube of 7 is 343\nJ is = 8\nThe Cube of 8 is 512\nJ is = 9\nThe Cube of 9 is 729\nJ is = 10\nThe Cube of 10 is 1000\n\n\nYou’ll notice that every statement requires it’s own set of for and end points, and is indented as per Julia’s requirements. if and else statements can be very useful when building experiments: for example we might want to stop simulating a network’s dynamics if more than 50% of the species have gone extinct.\n\n\ncontinue and while\n\ncontinue\nThe continue command is the opposite to break and can be useful when you want to skip an iteration but not stop the loop:\n\nfor i in 1:30\n    # this reads: is it false that i is a multiple of 3?\n    if i % 3 == false\n        continue # makes the loop skip iterations that are a multiple of 3\n    else println(\"$i is not a multiple of 3\")\n    end\nend\n\n1 is not a multiple of 3\n2 is not a multiple of 3\n4 is not a multiple of 3\n5 is not a multiple of 3\n7 is not a multiple of 3\n8 is not a multiple of 3\n10 is not a multiple of 3\n11 is not a multiple of 3\n13 is not a multiple of 3\n14 is not a multiple of 3\n16 is not a multiple of 3\n17 is not a multiple of 3\n19 is not a multiple of 3\n20 is not a multiple of 3\n22 is not a multiple of 3\n23 is not a multiple of 3\n25 is not a multiple of 3\n26 is not a multiple of 3\n28 is not a multiple of 3\n29 is not a multiple of 3\n\n\nCan you figure out what the code would be for keeping even numbers only? Note the change of logic from false above to true here.\n\nfor i in 1:10\n    # where is it true that i is a multiple of 2?\n    if i % 2 == true\n        continue # makes the loop skip iterations that are odd\n    else println(\"$i is even\")\n    end\nend\n\n2 is even\n4 is even\n6 is even\n8 is even\n10 is even\n\n\n\n\nwhile\nwhile loops provide an alternative to for loops and allow you to iterate until a certain condition is met:\n\n# counter that is globally scoped (see next section)\n# testval -- try changing this to see how this global variable can be used in \n# the local process below\nglobal j=0\nglobal testval = 17\n\n# note that we started with j = 0!!!\n# justify a condition\nwhile(j&lt;testval) \n    println(\"$j is definitely less than $testval\") # prints j until j &lt; 17\n    # step forward\n    j += 1 # count\nend\n\n0 is definitely less than 17\n1 is definitely less than 17\n2 is definitely less than 17\n3 is definitely less than 17\n4 is definitely less than 17\n5 is definitely less than 17\n6 is definitely less than 17\n7 is definitely less than 17\n8 is definitely less than 17\n9 is definitely less than 17\n10 is definitely less than 17\n11 is definitely less than 17\n12 is definitely less than 17\n13 is definitely less than 17\n14 is definitely less than 17\n15 is definitely less than 17\n16 is definitely less than 17\n\n\nwhile loops don’t require you to specify a looping sequence (e.g. i in 1:100). But you do specify the starting value. The while loop can be very useful because sometimes you simply don’t know how many iterations you might need.\nIn the above code, you might have spotted the word global. Variables can exist in the local or global scope. If a variable exists inside a loop or function it is local and if you want to save it beyond the loop (i.e., in your workspace) you have to make it global - more on this below.",

    "text": "Preamble to Objects like scalars, vectors and arrays\nBefore we start creating arrays and matrices, we’d like to demonstrate how you allocate numbers and strings to objects in Julia and check an object’s type. We’d also like to highlight some simple mathematical operations.\n\nAllocating data to objects\nAllocating in Julia is useful as it means that variables can be stored and used elsewhere. You allocate numbers to objects using the following:\nFirst note that we use the = in Julia, not the &lt;- as in R.\n\n# allocate an Integer number to a variable\nn = 5\n\n5\n\n\nJulia, like other languages, has some built in values, like pi. We can allocate these to variable names we will use. Notice that Julia converts pi into the unicode symbol!\n\n# allocate a pre-defined number of importance to a variable\n# note that pi is converted to π\n# note2 - you can use \\pi in a julia script to get the unicode π ...\n# this works for numerous greek letters etc.  Like \\lambda for λ\npi_sum = pi\npi_sum\n\nπ = 3.1415926535897...\n\n\nWe can use these unicode symbols (and emojis!), like λ, as objects\n\nλ = 4\nλ\n\n4\n\n\nYou can also assign multiple values to separate variables in a concise manner. Julia can manage something like this:\n\nαi, βi, γi = 1.3, 2.1, exp(39)\n\n# confirm...\nαi, βi, γi\n\n(1.3, 2.1, 8.659340042399374e16)\n\n\n\nAllocating strings\nOf course you can also allocate strings of text to objects. You must use the \"\" and not '' to define strings.\n\nsob = \"School of Biosciences\"\n\n\"School of Biosciences\"\n\n\nYou can combine strings and numbers to print like this. Note how you use $object.name within the text string you are writing… and this works for objects that are text or numeric.\n\nprintln(\"The favourite number in $sob is $n\")\n\nThe favourite number in School of Biosciences is 5\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the Type of object you’ve made\nJulia is very specific about types of objects. Most programming languages are. One way to learn about them is to look at what is made when you make things in different ways.\n\ntypeof(n), typeof(sob), typeof(pi)\n\n(Int64, String, Irrational{:π})\n\n\nJulia is like R and Python in that it can infer the type of object (Integer, Float, etc) on the left hand side of the equals sign - you don’t have to justify it like you do in C. However, you can declare the type if needed e.g.\n\npi_custom = Float64(3.141592)\n\n3.141592\n\n\nFor those of you that are interested, a floating-point object (a Float) is a number that has a decimal place. An Int object is an integer, a number without a decimal place, whereas an Irrational object is a specific type of Float used only for representing some irrational numbers of special significance (e.g. π and γ). The 64 purely refers to 64-bit which is the type of processor your computer uses, most modern computers are 64-bit.\nOccasionally it will be valuable to convert an object from one type to another. For example, n is currently an Integer (Int64), and we might want it to be Float (Float64). To be clear, this is a distinction between 5 and 5.0!\n\ntypeof(n)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nn2 = convert(Float64, n)\ntypeof(n2)\n\nFloat64",

    "text": "Understanding Arrays, Vectors and Sequences.\nAs you saw above, we created a sequence of numbers using collect(0:1:10). Let’s look at what type of object this is:\n\ntypeof(x)\n\n\nVector{Int64} (alias for Array{Int64, 1})\n\n\n\nThis is a vector. Let’s step back to see the difference between arrays and vectors. Arrays, for the R users, are best thought of as lists - they are storage boxes for any type of variables and can contain collections of various types. The general way to create an array, in this case and empty one, is the [ ].\n\nempty_array = []\n\nAny[]\n\n\nWe will first create an array with the same values as x and then see how collect() is the function that converts this to a vector, and actually lets us see the numbers too!\nFirst, range can be used to make an array. This is very similar to seq() in R and has the two variations - by and length that the R function has. The difference is that by is replaced by the argument step. Note how a very concise summary of this array is presented using information in square brackets [ ]:\n\nx_array1 = range(start = 1, step = 1, stop = 10)\nx_array2 = range(start = 1, stop = 10, length = 5)\n\nx_array1, x_array2\n\n(1:1:10, 1.0:2.25:10.0)\n\n\nYou can also now see that creating arrays is possible with [ ] and the use of the : :\n\nx_array3 = [1:1:10]\n\n1-element Vector{StepRange{Int64, Int64}}:\n 1:1:10\n\n\nQuite often, you want to either see the values, or specifically be using a vector. To do this, you can use the function collect():\n\ncollect(x_array1)\n\n10-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  6\n  7\n  8\n  9\n 10",

Making a matrix in Julia uses the [ ] again, an separates rows of numbers with the ;\n\nmat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]\n\n2×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3\n 4  5  6\n\n\nNote how there are NO commas between the numbers in each row! This is read as ‘rows are separated by ; and columns by spaces’!\nYou can also ‘pre-fill’ a matrix with zeros. This is good practice in loops and programming as pre-filling and replacing variables in a matrix is more efficient than creating the matrix on the fly. Here we demonstrate how to pre-fil a vector, matrix and high dimension array! Matrices can have more than two dimensions!\n\nvec0 = zeros(2) # 2 zeros allocated in a vector\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.0\n 0.0\n\n\n\nmat0 = zeros(2,3) # zeros allocated to 2 rows and 3 columns!\n\n2×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\n\narr0 = zeros(2,3,4) # 2 rows, 3 columns and 4 dimensions!\n\n2×3×4 Array{Float64, 3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\nAccessing values in a matrix follows the same convention as with the vector. The convention is [row, column]\n\nmat[1,2] # value in the first row and second column\n\n2\n\n\n\nmat[1:2, 3] # rows 1 AND 2 in the 3rd column\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 3\n 6\n\n\nFinally, to get a row or column, you need to know that we need a placeholder for the missing bit of what you are asking for. If we want the second row, we ask for row 2, and stick the : placeholder in the column spot:\n\nmat[2,:]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 4\n 5\n 6\n\n\nFor a column, we reverse this.\n\nmat[:,2]\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 5\n\n\n\nA quick interlude on types\nAs discussed earlier Julia is able to infer the type of an object based on the input. So the mat object we created earlier will be a matrix of integers i.e. Matrix{Int64}.\n\ntypeof(mat)\n\n\nMatrix{Int64} (alias for Array{Int64, 2})\n\n\n\nSo what happens if we want to replace one of the elements with a Float?\n\nmat[1,2] = 1.5\n\nThis is because we are trying to add a Float to an object that is of the type Integer. What happens if we convert mat to be a matrix of floats and then try again?\n\nmat = convert(Matrix{Float64}, mat)\nmat[1,2] = 1.5\n\n1.5",
